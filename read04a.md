# JavaScript

**I learned from this reading:**

1. how `javascript` make the web page dynamic by accessing the content of the page by the assigned attribute.
2. In order to write a code *effectively* first, you need to set some steps like a recipe.
3. saw some examples of what `javascript` can be in the browser.
4. some `javascript` codes are not supported in older browsers and jQuery helps us with getting rid of this problem.
5. a script is a series of instructions.
6. you need to state your goal and break it down into simple tasks and you can make a flowchart to make it easier.
7. six rules I need to follow when giving a variable a name
8. you can add expressions and operators (arithmetic, assignment, and string) using `javascript`.
