# Read 05

I learned about two types of operators:

1. Comparison operator:
   - == is equal to
   - !== is not equal to
   - === strict is equal to
   - !== strict not is equal to
   - ">" greater than
   - < less than
   - ">=" greater than or equal to
   - <= less than or equal to
2. Logical operator:
   - && AND
   - "||" OR
   - ! NOT

> short circuit evaluation to save some time while the code is running

- put false && anything with AND to ignore the second condition
- put true "||" anything with OR to ignore the second condition

## LOOPS

Learned how loops work and there are three common types:

1. FOR
2. WHILE
3. DO WHILE
   and the difference between them.
