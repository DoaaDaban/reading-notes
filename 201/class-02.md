# HTML Text

- The html text tags can be devided into two categories:
1. **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs, such as:
    - Headings.
    - <p> Paragraph
    - <b> bold
    - <i> italic
    - <sup> Superscript
    - <sub> Subscript
    - White Space
2. **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information, such as:
    - <strong>
    - <em>
    - <blockquote> can be used with cite attribute
    - <q> can be used with cite attribute
    - <abbr>
    - <cite> will be rendered as italics.
    - <dfn>
    - <address> often will be rendered as italics
    - <ins> underlined
    - <del> line through
    - <s> usually be displayed with a line through the center
