##  Process & Design
From this chapter, I learned that:
1. it is important to understand the user and know who they are and in general imagine myself as that user.
2. making a site map and wireframes helps with the structural plan and the content that should be in each page.
3. Visual hierarchy make the communication easier.
4. styles are very important in making the users differentiate between the content.

##  Structure
From this chapter, I learned that:
1. HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language that uses tags opining <> and closing tags </> and some the tags (elements) are self closing tags <img/>.
2. attributes tell us about the content of that element. 

## HTML5 Layout
From this chapter, I learned that the new HTML5 elements make the code clearer and give the elements more meaning in the code, and the older browsers can not understand HTML5 and to make it work you need to tell the browsers that these elements are block elements using css and in Internet Explorer 8 or older you need to add extra javascript code.

## Extra Markup
From this chapter, I learned that:
1. DOCTYPES is for HTML version
2. id is a unique attributes and a class allow you to identify elements
3. you can make comments by  <!-- -->
4. div is a block element and span is an inline element 
5. iframes cut windows into your web pages
6. The <meta> tag to add information about your web page.
7. Escape characters are used to include special characters
