Now I can tell the difference between a Text editor and an IDE, which is the IDE is an all-in-one software package but the text editor only helps you with your:

1. code completion.

2. syntax highlighting.

3. a nice variety of themes.

and in The command line article, I know what command-line arguments are, and some basic information about how to use them, and like the shortcuts, and the (-) before the command mean that those items are optional.

I am going to write the commands that I learned briefly:

1. pwd: to show the current directory.

2. ls: to show the files in the dir.

3. ls /etc: command line argument ( /etc ) to list that directories contents.

4. ls -la: to show all of the files with the hidden files too.

5. cd: to change the path.
